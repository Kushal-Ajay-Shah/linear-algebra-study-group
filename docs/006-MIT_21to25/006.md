* Sum(λ) = Trace, Product(λ) = Determinant
* Solving Ax = λx is same as solving (A - λI)x = 0
  * (A - λI) is singular, since x != 0 :thinking:
  * Hence we solve |A - λI| = 0
  * This is known as characteristic equation

# 22 - Diagonalizing a matrix (S<sub>-1</sub>AS = Λ), Powers of A, u<sub>k+1</sub> = Au<sub>k</sub>

* Suppose there are n independent eigen vectors of A
* Let `S` be matrix formed with columns containing eigen vectors
* AS = A[x1 x2 x3 ... xn] = [λ1x1 λ2x2 .... λnxn] = [x1 x2 x3 .... xn]`diagonal`([λ1 λ2 ... λn])
* AS = SΛ
* **A = SΛS<sup>-1</sup>** OR **Λ = S<sup>-1</sup>AS**
* A<sup>k</sup> = SΛ<sup>k</sup>S<sup>-1</sup>
* A is sure to have n independent eigen vectors and be diagonalizable if all λ's are different
* Repeated eigen values may or may not result in n independent eigen vectors
  * eg. Identity matrix
* Algebraic multiplicity - Number of times an eigen value is repeated
* Geometric multiplicity - Number of eigen vectors for a particular eigen value

* Fibonacci series - 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8.... F<sub>100</sub> = ?
* F<sub>k + 2</sub> = F<sub>k + 1</sub> + F<sub>k</sub> ... *We want to write this as u<sub>k+1</sub> = Au<sub>k</sub>*
* F<sub>k + 1</sub> = F<sub>k + 1</sub>
* **Trick**: Let u<sub>k</sub> = [F<sub>k + 1</sub> F<sub>k</sub>]
* Your work:- 
  * Find A, eigen value, vector
  * Use following logic for finding F<sub>100</sub>
  * u<sub>0</sub> = c<sub>1</sub>x<sub>1</sub> + c<sub>2</sub>x<sub>2</sub> + ... + c<sub>n</sub>x<sub>n</sub> = SC
  * A<sup>k</sup>u<sub>0</sub> = Λ<sup>k</sup>SC


# 23 - Differential equation (du/dt = Au), Exponent of matrix (e<sup>At</sup>)

* du / dt = Au ... u(t) = c<sub>1</sub>e<sup>λ1</sup>x<sub>1</sub> + c<sub>2</sub>e<sup>λ2</sup>x<sub>2</sub> + ... + c<sub>n</sub>e<sup>λn</sup>x<sub>n</sub>
* Stability, steady state or blow up based on λ
  * Stability - λ < 0
  * Steady state - one λ = 0 and other < 0
  * Blow up - if any λ > 0
  * **TODO** - Explain e<sup>At</sup>


# 24 - Markov matrices, Steady state, Fourier series and Projections

* Steady state - 
  * λ = 0 if exponents
  * λ = 1 if powers
* Markov matrix -
  * All elements >= 0
  * All columns add to 1
* Power of Markov matrix is another Markov matrix
* λ = 1 is an eigen value of Markov matrix and corresponding eigen vector has all its components > 0 => positive steady state
* All  other eigen values are between (-1, 1)
* **TODO**: Explain example of Markov matrix by migration system model
* V = QC (v = q<sub>1</sub>c<sub>1</sub> + q<sub>2</sub>c<sub>2</sub> ...) .... q = orthonormal basis
* C = Q<sup>-1</sup>V = Q<sup>T</sup>V .... hence can find all coefficients
* **TODO**: Explain Fourier series


# 25 - Symmetric matrices (Eigen values and vectors) and Positive definite matrices

* Positive definite symmetric matrix - 
  * All eigen values are positive
  * All pivots are positive
  * All sub-determinant positive
