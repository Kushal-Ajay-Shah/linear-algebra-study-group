## Geometry Of Linear Equations  
  
  
  Consider the given set of equations  
  2x - y  = 0  
  -x + 2y = 3

    This type of visualization is used to solve 2D equations generally.

* Column Picture  
  
    This provides better intution when dealing with higher or more complex equations and dimensions

- *NOTE* : If 3 columns are dependent on each other then the space where we get the solution is restricted to only that particular plane where these cols are present.
