# 5 - Permutations, Vector Spaces and Sub Spaces

* Permutation matrices execute row exchanges
  * Matlab does this to choose higher pivot, improving accuracy
  * Number of permutation matrices possible for a `nxn` matrix = n! (_Arrangement of rows_)
  * `PA = LU`
  * P is `orthonormal` i.e. P<sup>-1</sup> = P<sup>T</sup> and columns are unit vectors
  
* A<sup>T</sup>A is always symmetric i.e. its transpose is equal to itself
  
* **Vector Spaces** => set of vectors which satisfy closure property on linear combination
  * Linear combination = k<sub>1</sub>v<sub>1</sub> + k<sub>2</sub>v<sub>2</sub>
    * where k<sub>x</sub> = scalars and v<sub>x</sub> vectors from that set
  * Closure = After taking linear combination the resultant vector must belong to same set
  * Hence `Zero or null` vector must be present in any vector space

* **Sub Spaces** => subset of vector space which satisfies the above closure property
  * R<sup>2</sup> has R<sup>2</sup>, R<sup>1</sup> through origin, R<sup>0</sup> i.e origin as subspaces
  
* **Column Space** => Span of columns of a matrix


# 6 - Solutions of Ax=b, Null Space

* If P and L are two subspaces
  * Their `union` is always a subspace
  * Their `intersection` may or may not be subspace
  
* Does Ax=b have a solution for every b?
  * No, only those `b` have a solution which lie in C(A)
  * Since `Ax` is nothing but linear combination of columns of A, which is span

* **Null Space** => set of vectors satisfying `Ax = 0`
  * Always a subspace

* Solution of `Ax = b` can be expressed as **x = x<sub>p</sub> + Cx<sub>s</sub>**
  * x<sub>p</sub> = particular solution
  * x<sub>s</sub> = special solution , Ax<sub>s</sub> = 0
  * A (x<sub>p</sub> + Cx<sub>s</sub>) = b


# 7 - Computing Null Space, Pivot/Free variables, Reduced Row Echelon form

* `pivot` = first non zero element in every row after elimination
* `pivot columns` = columns containing pivot 
* `pivot variables` = variables corresponding to pivot columns
* `free columns` = columns without pivot
* `free variables` = variables corresponding to free columns

> add image of matrix elimination process

* **Reduced row echelon form (rref)** = pivot should be `1` and elements above pivot should be `0`

> add image of rref matrix

* R = 
  |     |     |
  | --- | --- |
  | I   | F   |
  | 0   | 0   |

* `RN = 0`
