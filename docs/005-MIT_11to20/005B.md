# 16 - Projections and Least square fitting of straight line

* if `b` in column space of `A`, then Pb = b
* if `b` ⊥ column space, then Pb = 0, since b in null space
  
* Show example of fitting straight line

* If A has independent columns, then A<sup>T</sup>A is invertible
  * To prove above statement, prove the null space of A<sup>T</sup>A contains only zero vector
  * A<sup>T</sup>Ax = 0
  * x<sup>T</sup>A<sup>T</sup>Ax = 0
  * (Ax)<sup>T</sup>Ax = 0
  * Ax = 0
  * x = 0

* Columns are definitely independent if they are perpendicular vectors


# 17 - Orthogonal basis, Orthogonal square matrix (Q), Gram-Schmidt (A --> Q)

* Orthonormal vector - 
  * q<sub>i</sub><sup>T</sup>q<sub>j</sub> = 0, if i is not equal to j
  * q<sub>i</sub><sup>T</sup>q<sub>j</sub> = 1, if i is equal to j

* Q<sup>T</sup>Q = I
* if Q is square - Q<sup>T</sup> = Q<sup>-1</sup>
* What is made easier?
  * Projection matrix calculation
  * P = Q(Q<sup>T</sup>Q)<sup>-1</sup>Q<sup>T</sup> = QQ<sup>T</sup>, I if Q is square

* Gram-Schmidt (make matrix A to Q)
  * [Diagram]
  * take independent vectors of A - a, b
  * Make them orthogonal by projection
  * Normalize for orthonormal
  * For multiple vectors - one by one take vector and remove components of previous vectors from it

# 18 - Determinants, Properties

1. det(I) = 1
2. row exchange reverses the sign of determinant
3. [Diagram]
   1. Multiplier from row can be taken common and determinant will be multiplied by the same
   2. Determinant can be split with respect to one row
4. 2 equal or dependent rows --> det = 0
5. Subtract l x row<sub>i</sub> from row<sub>k</sub> --> determinant doesn't change
6. row of 0's --> det = 0
7. upper triangular --> det = product of diagonal entries
8. det(A) = 0 ↔ A is singular **OR** det(A) ≠ 0 ↔ A is invertible
9. det(AB) = det(A)*det(B)
10. det(A<sup>T</sup>) = det(A)

**All above properties also holds for column

* determinant of skew-symmetric matrix = 0 (use rule `10`)


# 19 - Determinant Formula, Cofactors formula, Tridiagonal matrices

* Use rule 3.2 of determinant properties
* n! terms

* Cofactors - connect nxn determinant to (n-1)x(n-1)
* det(A) = a<sub>1</sub><sub>1</sub>C<sub>1</sub><sub>1</sub> + a<sub>1</sub><sub>2</sub>C<sub>1</sub><sub>2</sub> + ..... + a<sub>1</sub><sub>n</sub>C<sub>1</sub><sub>n</sub>

* Tridiagonal matrices [Diagram]
* det(A<sup>n</sup>) = det(A<sup>n-1</sup>) - det(A<sup>n-2</sup>)


# 20 - Formula for A<sup>-1</sup>, Cramer's rule, det(A) = Volume of box

* AC<sup>T</sup> = det(A) I
* A<sup>-1</sup> = (1 / |A|) C<sup>T</sup>....**C = Cofactor matrix**
* row<sub>i</sub> * Cofactors<sub>j</sub> = 0 .....**if i != j**
  * Hint: Identical rows
* Cramer's Rule:
  * Used for solving **Ax = b**
  * x = A<sup>-1</sup>b
  * x = (1 / |A|) C<sup>T</sup>b
  * x<sub>1</sub> = det(B<sub>1</sub>) / det(A), x<sub>2</sub> = det(B<sub>2</sub>) / det(A)
    * B<sub>j</sub> = Matrix A with j<sup>th</sup> column substituted by `b`
* Determinant of 3x3 matrix = Volume of space enclosed by the column vectors (Refer 3b1b video for visualization)
