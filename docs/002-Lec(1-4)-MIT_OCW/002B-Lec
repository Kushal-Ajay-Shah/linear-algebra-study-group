Elimination with matrices

A = 1 2 1             1 2 1             1 2 1 
    3 8 1    -------> 0 2 -2 -------->  0 2 -1
    0 4 1             0 4 1             0 0 5
                                          U
                                          
                                          

Rows(A) multiplied by some matrix(X) is the linear combination of the all rows of the row matrix.(AX = B)

Matrix(A) multiplied by a column is linear combinations of all the columns of the column matrix


(E32 E31 E21)A = U(Upper triangular matrix)
